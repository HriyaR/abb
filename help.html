    <h1>How Do You Help Someone With An Eating Disorder?</h1>
    <h3>People with eating disorders use food to deal with uncomfortable or painful emotions. Restricting food is used to feel in control. Overeating temporarily soothes sadness, anger, or loneliness. Purging is used to combat feelings of helplessness and self-loathing. Over time, people with an eating disorder lose the ability to see themselves objectively and obsessions over food and weight come to dominate everything else in their lives.</h3>
<br>
    <h3>Pick a good time to talk about the matter.</h3>
    <h3>Explain why you’re concerned.</h3>
    <h3>Be patient and supportive.</h3>
    <h3>Do whatever you can to promote self-esteem. </h3>
    <h3>Learn about eating disorders.</h3>
    <h3>Be mindful of triggers.</h3>
